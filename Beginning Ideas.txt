Beginning Ideas for mnexacore
<ef1500>

Objective: Create a simple language to generate flashcards, It must take the code and convert it into C++ code,
where the next files can process it. 

Initial Idea:

<Flashcards>

[Init]
$Title "title"
$Author "author"

[Begin]
# <type> is the response type, which I hope to implement later on, if I get a community and support
# the only "type" I have so far is multiple choice, and it's denoted as "mtc"
# the number in the brackets is the question's Root ID, which will be used to create similar questions (hopefully)
# also, I envision the Root ID to be used in the retriveal of answers.

# Question Template Idea one
$q<type> "Question?" [0000]

# Second Idea - Added a name "A" because The questions are the equivalent of std::vector and this would make it easier to store stuff in
# Question Template Idea Two
$q<type> A "Question?" [0000]

[End]

Now that I think about it, I feel that I could add some sort of less intensive language to make flashcards.

I could use SQLite database implementation. Yeah, I'm gonna use that.
